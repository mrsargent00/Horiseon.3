## Description

I was given the challenge to look over premade code, and correct it look much nicer. I worked on this project because I wanted to learn how to correct code from either premade code, or from a peer. It was a challenge to look through the premade code, and note what was wrong with it. Originally, I thought we had to make our own code with the information that was provided in class, but that was definitely not what I was suppose to do. I solved how to change title, link an image from the top of the page to the placement on the page. I learned how to link images to links on top of the page, how to correct code in areas and make it function better, and I added voice to talk on images with appropriate descriptions. I had done this project with three other people, we had sat and discussed what we were suppose to do, and helped one another through it.
